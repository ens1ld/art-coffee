# Art Coffee – Project Rules for Cursor

1. Project Type:
   - This is a **Next.js 13+** app using the **app/ directory**.
   - Project is deployed on **Vercel**.
   - Backend and authentication use **Supabase**.

2. Pages and Structure:
   - All routes are inside `src/app/`.
   - Each page folder (e.g., `/order`, `/admin`) must have a `page.js` file with a default React export.
   - Do NOT use `pages/` directory structure.

3. Routing:
   - Use only file-based routing via folders like `/order`, `/bulk-order`, etc.
   - Every route should be linked from the homepage (`/`).

4. Design & Functionality:
   - Keep designs minimal and user-friendly.
   - Use Tailwind CSS or inline CSS Modules only if necessary.
   - Prioritize **working UI flows** (order, gift cards, loyalty points).
   - No unnecessary complexity or external libraries unless I approve.

5. Superadmin/Admin:
   - Superadmin manages user accounts and sees more data.
   - Admin dashboard handles order views, loyalty analytics, etc.
   - These must be on different routes: `/superadmin` and `/admin`.

6. No App:
   - This is a **web-only** PWA, not a mobile app.
   - All QR scanning must work via the browser.

7. Data:
   - All backend data is in Supabase.
   - Tables: `users`, `products`, `orders`, `order_items`, `gift_cards`, `loyalty_transactions`.
   - Respect foreign key relationships.

8. When in doubt:
   - Ask me before creating new pages, folders, or components.
   - Never auto-install large libraries without confirming.

9. Component Naming:
   - Every component and file should use **PascalCase** or **kebab-case** (no spaces, no underscores).
   - `page.js` must always be inside a folder matching the route (e.g., `/order/page.js` for `/order`).

10. Homepage:
   - The homepage (`src/app/page.js`) must:
     - Link to all main pages: `/order`, `/bulk-order`, `/gift-card`, `/loyalty`, `/admin`, `/superadmin`.
     - Contain a clean navigation section or buttons.
     - Serve as the entry point during demo.

11. Auth:
   - Assume future implementation of **Supabase Auth** but **do NOT include login flows unless requested**.
   - Allow page access without login for now, unless I ask to change it.

12. Environment Variables:
   - All Supabase keys and URLs must be stored in `.env.local`.
   - Never hardcode private keys or project references in files.

13. Vercel Compatibility:
   - All routes must render correctly on Vercel (no dynamic routing unless explicitly configured).
   - Avoid server-only logic in `page.js` or client-only code in server components.

14. Deployment Testing:
   - Assume I will test each page manually.
   - Include a visible `<h1>` heading in every page for confirmation.
   - Use test data placeholders in the UI until the database is fully connected.

15. Development Style:
   - Use **functional components only** (no class components).
   - Keep code simple, readable, and hackathon-friendly — minimal nesting, clean layout, and short function blocks.
